##Introduction

##Problem

We were emailed by an international organization called "Yes Women, Yes Tech" (YWYT) asking for assistance. the organization aims to get more women invisted in the tech fields. Therefore, they are looking for people to sign-up with their emails in order to send them the latest news and event dates regarding the subject. They are also hosting a gala at the beginning of summer and would like to invite as many people as possible. Their approach is to talk to people at New York City (NYC) subway stations. The organization is asking us to provide them with recomindations reagrding locations, dates and times in which they would have more chances of success.

The first project of the bootcamp consist of  exploratory data analysis (EDA) on New York City (NYC) subways data that was provided by the MTA website. Our client Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that needs to send their team to the NYC subway station to invite people to their gala by collecting emails from people and send to them a free ticket to enter their gala at the beginning of the summer. They want from us as a data scientist to provide them the best station, days, and times that they can send their team and collect the maximum amount of emails and invite people to their gala.
