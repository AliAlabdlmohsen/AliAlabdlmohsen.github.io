## Introduction

We were emailed by an international organization called "Yes Women, Yes Tech" (YWYT) asking for assistance. the organization aims to get more women invisted in the tech fields. Therefore, they are looking for people to sign-up with their emails in order to send them the latest news and event dates regarding the subject. They are also hosting a gala at the beginning of summer and would like to invite as many people as possible. Their approach is to talk to people at New York City (NYC) subway stations. The organization is asking us to provide them with recomindations reagrding locations, dates and times in which they would have more chances of success.
