# Introduction

We were emailed by an international organization called "Yes Women, Yes Tech" (YWYT) asking for assistance. the organization aims to get more women invisted in the tech fields. Therefore, they are looking for people to sign-up with their emails in order to send them the latest news and event dates regarding the subject. They are also hosting a gala at the beginning of summer and would like to invite as many people as possible. Their approach is to talk to people at New York City (NYC) subway stations. The organization is asking us to provide them with recomindations reagrding locations, dates and times in which they would have more chances of success.

# Steps

**Data Collection**
Data was collected from the [MTA website](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). The website provides weekly text files contating the turnstiles reading across all NYC stations. The team decided to look into data files with turnstile readings starting from May 4th and up to June 1st. This because the gala is being held at the beginning of summer and the month pior to that would be the best time to invite poeple.

**Data Cleaning**
The text files that were gathered from the MTA website had some unnecessary data for the purposes of this project. information regarding control area, line name, division and deck were eliminated in order to simplify the analysis part of the project.

**Data Analysis**
At first, the team looked into the top five subway stations in terms of volume of trafic. These stations were deemed to be the most important ones based on the assumption that more people means more chances of sign-ups.

  Then, we computed the average number of entries and exits across all stations based on the day of the week. This can provide information about which days the subway system is more crowded with potential sign-ups.
  
  Finally, we went a step deeper by analyzing the average entries for each day of the week based on time. This is usefull as deferent days have deferent rush hour times.
